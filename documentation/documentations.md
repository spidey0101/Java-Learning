# Documentation Guidelines

We encourage contributors to add comprehensive documentation for various Java concepts. This will help learners gain a deeper understanding of best practices and common pitfalls associated with each topic. Here are some guidelines to follow when creating documentation:

1. **Title**: Use a clear and descriptive title for the documentation page.

2. **Introduction**: Provide a brief overview of the concept being covered.

3. **Usage**: Include examples and code snippets to illustrate how to use the concept in real-world scenarios.

4. **Best Practices**: Share recommended practices and patterns for using the concept effectively.

5. **Common Pitfalls**: Highlight any potential mistakes or misunderstandings that learners should be aware of.

6. **References**: If applicable, include links to external resources or articles for further reading.

Feel free to create a new markdown file for each concept you'd like to document. If you have any questions or need further assistance, don't hesitate to ask!
